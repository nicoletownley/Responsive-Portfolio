should pull through to all three documents once I figure out what he was talking about. I will use id "yourname" to style this portion of the header in css and across documents....haha! to             -->
			<!-- These should be navigation tags cause you will be navigating the pages  from each page. Save work and go offline to investigate navigation before changing. Also research how to change handle the divs in the header. There are too many header/div/html interface for divs in the header section. Need to think about how many divs will be necessary for header give links usage instead of divs. Can we format the links  - float - in css?   -->
